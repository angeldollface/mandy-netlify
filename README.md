***A sample Mandy project for deploying your project on Netlify. :fire: :rocket:***

## ABOUT :books:

This repository contains the source code of a sample Mandy-powered project to deploy Mandy-powered projects on Netlify. If you don't know what Mandy is, click [this link](https://angeldollface.art/mandys-house). If you'd like to know what Netlify is, [click here](https://netlify.com).

## USAGE :hammer_and_pick:

To use this template site for your own Mandy-powered site, you need to have Mandy installed. To find out how to do that, head over to [this link](https://angeldollface.art/mandys-house/documentation/installation). Once you have Mandy installed, you can use this template in the following way:

- 1.) Check you have the latest version of Mandy installed:

```bash
mandy -v
```

- 2.) Create a new Mandy-powered site using this template (`mysite` is the directory in which your new Mandy site will be created.):

```bash
mandy -i mysite -w angeldollface/mandy-netlify
```

- 3.) Change into your site's root directory:

```bash
cd mysite
````

- 4.) Start the development server:

```bash
mandy -s .
```

- 5.) Open a browser window at the address that is output in the terminal session. Pretty rad, huh? :heart_on_fire:
